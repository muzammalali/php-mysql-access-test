# php-mysql-access-test
Simple script to check access to mysql databases from PHP using `mysql`, `mysqli` and `PDO_mysql` drivers
Just add `mysql.php` script to some place in document root, fill in access data and visit script from browser.

Useful for sysadmins/developers that want to check fresh install of `PHP` and `MySQL` is working together. I used it to check Docker setup.
